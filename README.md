# Sluggo-Evolution
Proposals for the Sluggo project will go here, along with any design documents
that may be beneficial in development or to others.

The main branch represents all proposals in a reviewed state. A proposal being
merged into main does not represent acceptance of the proposal.

## Proposal Guidelines
Keeping it loose for now, a proposal should describe in reasonable detail some
technical mechanism, UX design, or otherwise which you want to add into the
project. Follow these guidelines:

* Create your proposal in a user/feature branch 
(e.g. `sluggodev/super-cool-feature`)
* Create the proposal with a Markdown file named as follows: 
`001_proposal_name.md`, with the number being the first number sequentially
higher than the previous. (We can correct this during merge if necessary).
Use the template in the `proposals/` directory
* Create a corresponding GitHub Issue with your proposal, labelling it
appropriately. This can be used for major discussion or summary of changes.
* We will merge the PR with the proposal in, and begin discussion
* The proposal will continuously evolve with discussion, until it is
eventually accepted or rejected (we'll decide on a good consensus mechanism 
later)
